# ETH-Beginner-Submission
In the ETH-Proof-Beginner course by Metacrafters, total basics about Web3 and solidity is taught. I got to know about how things in Web3 are different than in Web2. Also how Ethereum blockchain works and many more. Also the course included fundamentals of Solidity, which introduced me things like Variables, Functions, Gas and other such concepts in Solidity. And at the last my Challenge is to put all these things together and make my own Token.

## Description

In this challenge, I have made my own token by initialising it's details like it's name "AKASH", abbreviation "ASH", total supply "0". Then there are two functions named Mint and Burn. Where user can mint new tokens from there account and also burn the token if they have enough balance for it.

## Getting Started
The code was written in Solidity, by using all the concepts I learned in ETH-Proof-Beginner course.

### Installing

* There is no need to install any programs locally, you can copy-paste the code in Online Remix IDE to execute it.

### Executing program

* After you have the code pasted in Remix, just compile it from the menu of the left side.
* When the compilation is successful, there is an option to deploy the code just below it. After deploying, you be required to input the certain parameters we have included in the contract.

## Help

As learning from Metacrafters, it was really an easy process as whenever I needed any help, I just looked through the discord channel of Metacrafters, as there the community is so active.
